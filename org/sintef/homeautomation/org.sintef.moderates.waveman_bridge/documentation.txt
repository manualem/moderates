This device can be used to receive signals from Waveman equipments and ESIC temperature/humidity sensor.
When data is received on the 434MHz radio receiver messages are sent on the serial port.
The format of the message is the following. Each message is one line terminated by the characters 0x0A 0x0D (\u0A0D).

For ESIC temperature sensors:
------------------------------

* ESIC X.Y TTT.T HHH

X.Y corresponds to the ID of the sensor
TTT.T is the temperature in °C
HHH is the relative Humidity between 14 and 99

Examples:

ESIC 1.1 23.7 14
ESIC 1.4 -1.8 0
ESIC 1.3 21.3 14
ESIC 1.2 -33.0 14
ESIC 1.1 23.7 14

For Waveman equipements:
------------------------

* WM HC 0X

H is the House code in hexadecimal (0 -> F)
C is the channel in hexadecimal (0 -> F)
X is the command (0 for OFF and E for ON)

Examples:

WM C0 0E
WM C1 0E
WM F2 00
WM F1 0E
WM 21 0E

The bridge also support sending messages to Waveman equipments and storing a set of bindings between Waveman equipments.
Here are the corresponding commands:

Sending a message:
------------------

* WMB SD HC 0X

Sends the message X to the device with ID HC.
Example: WMB SD 20 00

Managing bindings:
------------------

* WMB CL
clear all bindings

* WMB LS
List bindings. The list of binding is listed with this format:
WMB LIST:
  B F1 0E 10 0E
  B F1 00 10 00
;
One binding per line and terminated with a line with a semicolon.

* WMB AD SS 0X DD 0Y
Add a binding between SS 0X and DD 0Y. 
Whenever the message SS 0X will be received the message DD 0Y will be transmitted. 
example: WMB AD F3 0E 21 0E


* WMB RM SS 0X DD 0Y
Remove a binding.
